The [source code for Blond](https://github.com/namin/blond) is also readily available, and the two implementations can be diffed with
```
git diff --no-index $BLOND/blond.scm lavender.scm
```
assuming `$BLOND` has the path to the blond repository.

A smaller metacircular reflective tower inspired by Blond can be found in this lecture:
